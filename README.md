# Airflow Data Pipeline Automation

This project provides a workflow using Apache Airflow to automate the data pipeline for a specific use case. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how Airflow can be used to automate the process of extracting, transforming, and loading data from various sources into a data warehouse or data lake.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Apache Airflow installed on your system. You can follow the installation instructions provided by the official Airflow documentation [here](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start/index.html).

Once you have Airflow installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine and create a new virtual environment using the requirements.txt file provided:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/airflow-data-pipeline-automation.git
$ cd airflow-data-pipeline-automation
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, you can initialize the Airflow database and start the Airflow web server: 
``bash
`$ airflow db init
 $ airflow webserver --port 8080
```
